# javascript-exo

This repository contains a collection of small JavaScript exercises I built while learning and practicing front-end development.

Each project is in its own folder and focuses on basic DOM manipulation, user interaction, or logic handling.

## Projects

- 🎨 Color Flipper
- 🔁 Palindrome Checker
- 💬 Random Quote Generator
- ⏱️ Stopwatch
- 📝 To Do List (with localStorage)
- ✊🖐✌️ Rock Paper Scissors

Feel free to explore each one — most of them are built using only vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
